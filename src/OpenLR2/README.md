# OpenLR2

本工作区的构建入口位于根目录 `../../build.cmd -EngineOnly`，目录说明与 Windows 构建文档见
[工作区首页](../../README.md)和[编译说明](../../docs/getting-started/build-and-run.md)。以下保留上游项目说明。

Rewritten source code of BMS player Lunatic Rave 2. Project started in January 2021.
Original code accessible at [LR2Beta3-v100201](https://github.com/GOMazk/OpenLR2/tree/LR2Beta3-v100201)

## Open source?

After the closure of LR2IR, the project has been made public.

## Installation

- Download unmodified Lunatic Rave 2 beta3 100201 [archive.org Download](
https://web.archive.org/web/20190802100906/http://www.dream-pro.info/~lavalse/LR2IR/search.cgi?mode=download)

- Place the OpenLR2 executable in the root folder of your freshly downloaded LR2. You can also optionally replace the original LR2body.exe.

> [!CAUTION]
> OpenLR2 uses the same score DB as the original LR2.
>
> To avoid data corruption, it's generally recommended to have a fresh LR2 directory, or use the "-ns" flag.
>
> Backing up your "LR2files\Database\Score\" folder is highly recommended.

> [!NOTE]
> Existing song.db will be refreshed on first OpenLR2 launch.
> That is normal.
> This is needed because LR2 didn't account for leap year days in database timestamps.

## New Features

- Proper fullscreen support – The game doesn't crash on Alt+Tab or when toggling window mode with F4 in-game.
- Gauge Auto Shift (GAS) – Changes the gauge to the easier one automatically if you failed on the selected one. You can access GAS options in MANIAC OPTIONS by pressing F2 in-game and going to the 3rd page using the arrow keys.
- Native fast/slow support
- Quick restart – Lets you restart the chart without going to result screen. Press both Start and Select, then quickly release and press either Start for a new random, or Select for the same random you had before.
- MainBPM Hi-Speed Fix – Hi-Speed anchor is set at the most prevalent BPM in the chart.
- UTF-8 support – Essentially means you don't need to change the locale in Windows settings to play.
- Frame Limiter - Replace vSync, which has a problem with tickrate.
- Unrandomizer - Input '/random 1357246' or any number you want into search bar. Input '/random 0' to reset the unrandomizer.
- Mordern BMS command support ([Document](../../docs/compatibility/bms.md))
  * Base62 support – support more keysounds on some newer charts that require them.
- New skin command support  ([Document](../../docs/compatibility/lr2-skins.md))

## How do I use HD skins with OpenLR2?

<img width="441" height="64" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30f21a53-aa14-430b-ae74-9a11c62f3c49" />

- Add the corresponding #RESOLUTION under #INFORMATION in your .lr2skin files for each of the game scenes (music select, decide, play, result, course result...) Refer to the image above as an example.

- You can also set default resolution in "LR2files/Config/openlr2-config.xml" (0:SD 1:HD 2:FHD)

# For developers

## Building

Open the project folder in Visual Studio.
It will automatically pick up the CMake project.

Alternatively, use the .sln build. Open the `OpenLR2.sln` file in Visual Studio. ([you need vcpkg installed](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/vcpkg-is-now-included-with-visual-studio/))

### Linux

Only provided for development purposes, not for use in production.

```bash
make -C ./dep/dxlib-for-linux/DxLib clean
CXXFLAGS=$(pkg-config --cflags opusfile) make -C ./dep/dxlib-for-linux/DxLib -j$(nproc)
rm -rf build
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)
```

## Libraries (you don't need to get these)

- DxLib 3.01a => 3.24f (custom old dxa) – currently using custom dxlib to read dxa files.
- FMODex 4.13.4(080401) => FMOD 2.3.10
- SQLite 3.6.7
- tinyxml
- md5.c, md5.h
